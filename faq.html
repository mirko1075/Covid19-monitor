                    <ul>
                      <li>The virus that causes COVID-19 most commonly spreads between people who are in close contact
                        with one another (within about 6 feet, or 2 arm lengths).</li>
                      <li>It spreads through respiratory&nbsp;<strong>droplets or small particles, such as those in
                          aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or
                          breathes</strong>.
                        <ul>
                          <li>These&nbsp;<strong>particles can be inhaled </strong>into the nose, mouth, airways, and
                            lungs and cause infection.&nbsp;<strong>This is thought to be the main way the virus
                              spreads.</strong></li>
                          <li>Droplets can also land on surfaces and objects and be transferred by touch. A person may
                            get COVID-19 by&nbsp;<strong>touching the surface or object that has the virus on it
                            </strong>and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. Spread from touching surfaces is
                            not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>It is possible that <strong>COVID-19 may spread through the droplets and airborne particles
                          that are formed when a person who has COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or
                          breathes.&nbsp;</strong>There is growing evidence that droplets and airborne particles can
                        remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond 6 feet
                        (for example, during choir practice, in restaurants, or in fitness classes). In general, indoor
                        environments without good ventilation increase this risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (&ldquo;community
                      spread&rdquo;) in&nbsp;many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been
                      infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became
                      infected.</p>

                      that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.&nbsp;
